#  EPL Predictor: Forecasting the Premier League with Machine Learning üèÜ

Have you ever argued with friends about who will win the league or get relegated? This project takes that passion and channels it into a robust, data-driven machine learning pipeline to predict the outcomes of the English Premier League.

This isn't just about predicting a single match; it's about building an end-to-end system that cleans over a decade of historical data, engineers intelligent features, evaluates a wide array of models, and ultimately, simulates an entire 380-game season to forecast the final league table.

## ‚ú® Key Project Highlights

* **Massive Dataset**: Trained and tested on over **15 seasons** of historical match data from both the Premier League and the Championship.
* **Advanced Feature Engineering**: Moved beyond simple stats to create dynamic "form" metrics (rolling averages of goals) and contextual features like a team's **promotion/relegation status**.
* **The Model Gauntlet**: Rigorously evaluated **8 different machine learning models**‚Äîfrom classic baselines to modern powerhouses like XGBoost and LightGBM‚Äîto find the best tool for the job.
* **In-Depth Evaluation**: Went beyond simple accuracy to measure model performance using **Precision, Recall, and F1-Score**, providing a complete picture of predictive power.
* **End-to-End Season Simulation**: The final output is not just a single prediction, but a fully simulated league table, generated by predicting every future match of the season.

## ‚öôÔ∏è The Machine Learning Pipeline

This project follows a comprehensive data science workflow from data ingestion to final prediction.

### 1. Data Collection & Cleaning

The foundation of any good model is good data. The process started with raw CSV files from `football-data.co.uk`. The crucial first step was a robust cleaning and preprocessing phase, which included:
* Aggregating 16+ separate CSV files into a single, master dataset.
* **Standardizing team names** across all seasons (e.g., ensuring 'Man Utd' and 'Man United' are treated as the same entity).
* Parsing and standardizing date formats to ensure chronological integrity.

### 2. Feature Engineering

This is where data becomes intelligent. I engineered features that give the model crucial context about the state of the teams going into a match:

* **Team Form**: Instead of just looking at a team's name, the model sees their recent performance. I implemented a system to calculate rolling averages for goals scored and conceded over the last 5 games. A team in hot-scoring form is fundamentally different from a team in a slump, and the model can now see that.

* **Promotion Status**: The model also knows which teams were newly promoted in any given season. This is a vital piece of context, as promoted teams often perform differently than established Premier League sides.

### 3. Model Evaluation & Selection

No single model is perfect for every problem. I therefore put 8 different algorithms to the test in a "Model Gauntlet" to see which could best handle the complexities of football data.

The models were evaluated on a dedicated, unseen test set. The results were clear:

| Model                  | Accuracy | Precision | Recall   | F1-Score |
| ---------------------- | -------- | --------- | -------- | -------- |
| **Gaussian Naive Bayes** | **0.492** | **0.496** | **0.492** | **0.477** |
| **Logistic Regression** | **0.522** | **0.495** | **0.522** | **0.467** |
| **LightGBM** | **0.500** | **0.464** | **0.500** | **0.465** |
| XGBoost                | 0.497    | 0.462     | 0.497    | 0.465    |
| Random Forest          | 0.496    | 0.447     | 0.496    | 0.452    |
| Gradient Boosting      | 0.512    | 0.479     | 0.512    | 0.448    |
| K-Nearest Neighbors    | 0.438    | 0.436     | 0.438    | 0.434    |
| Support Vector Machine | 0.505    | 0.462     | 0.505    | 0.425    |

Based on the **F1-Score**, a robust metric that balances precision and recall, the top 3 models were identified for the final simulation.

### 4. Full Season Simulation

The final step was to train the top 3 models on the *entire* historical dataset and use them to predict the 2025-2026 season. The simulation is dynamic:
1.  The model predicts the result of a future match.
2.  The predicted result is added to the team's history.
3.  This new result influences the team's "form" for the *next* match's prediction.
4.  This process repeats for all 380 games, resulting in a complete, predicted league table.

*** The models predictions are purely based on some key features that I manually engineered. The current season depends on lot of factors like team signings, transfers, injuries, players last game forms ( including pre season friendly ), formations, and other things. This could be applied as features in a new project file which I am currently working on ***
